# wdkeep

The goal of `wdkeep` is the perfect Filecoin space-time proof service, which supports multiple miners, runs safely and stably, and can be deployed quickly.

It is under development ...

it will be able to run in the near future.

However, please note that it should be used on the mainnet after the release.
